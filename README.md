DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:
In this third project, we take our understanding of text generation a step further by either fine-tuning a pre-trained model like GPT-2 or building a more advanced custom sequence model with additional features like embeddings, attention, or GRU layers. This is where we start to move from just using pre-trained models to customizing them for specific datasets or applications.

The tools used in this project include Hugging Face Transformers, TensorFlow/Keras, Google Colab, and custom preprocessing libraries. These tools combine the flexibility of Python-based development with the power of deep learning.

If this project involves fine-tuning GPT-2, we likely used Hugging Face’s Trainer API or its pipeline to set up a training loop. This allows us to customize the model with our own dataset — such as historical speeches, news, or song lyrics — so that it generates more domain-specific text.

Instead of relying purely on GPT-2’s general knowledge, fine-tuning adjusts the model’s weights based on the new text examples, improving its contextual understanding in niche domains.

Real-world uses:

Legal document generation trained on law texts

Medical report assistance using clinical notes

Customer service bots fine-tuned on chat logs

Marketing copywriting tools tuned on brand voice

If this project uses a custom architecture, we may have designed a network with word embeddings, GRU (Gated Recurrent Units), and attention mechanisms. GRUs are a lightweight alternative to LSTMs and are often faster. Attention helps the model “focus” on important parts of the input sequence when generating text — like knowing which previous words are more important.

This kind of architecture gives us more flexibility and deeper control over how the model learns from sequence data.

Real-world uses:

Machine translation (like Google Translate)

Summarization tools for news/articles

AI writing tools for essays, bios, product descriptions

Automated poetry or screenplay generation
